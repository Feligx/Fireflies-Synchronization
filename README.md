# Fireflies Synchronization

The purpose of this project is to model the process where fireflies go from an unsynchronized
state to a state where they all blink in unison. Another objective is to make a simulation of this
phenomenon in a 2D grid in MATLAB for a visual demonstration of the synchronization.

Along the project four different ways of modeling a synchronization were analyzed, each one of them has a MATLAB implementation wich can be found on their respective folder on this repo.
